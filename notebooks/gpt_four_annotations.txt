<NAV>And looming over all, to the west of the now sadly decaying villa, are the tall and
stark skeletal structures of a pair of nineteenth-century gasholders. It’s well
worth clambering off the canal here to take a closer look at this threatened
piece of industrial and once ornamental London. Go up the stairs to the east of
the bridges, cross the Cambridge Heath Road/Mare Street bridge to the south side
of the canal and head down the grandly named Corbridge Crescent towards the
villa.</NAV> 
<NAV>A narrow
alley – Grove Passage – lurks below the crushing form of the railway viaduct,
and Corbridge Crescent suddenly exposes its early granite setts which, during my
last visit at twilight, glistened with moisture and led to a strange and exotic
world that unfolded around and in front of the Regency villa.</NAV> 
<NAV>This marks the end of Corbridge Crescent, which now leads to The Oval – a small
piece of neoclassical town planning that incorporated an elongated circus,
somewhat in the Nash manner of Regent’s Park.</NAV> 
<NAV>Only a short distance away, on Hackney Road, there are still
substantial rows of early-nineteenth-century terraces and semi-detached villas.</NAV> 

<REASON> The first annotation was done because it most closely follows T1, T2, T4 and T5. It has explicit walking instructions, it's a long instruction, it has directions (east, south) and it mentions crossing a bridge.

<NAV>Before returning to the canal, cross to the east side of Cambridge
Heath Road and into Vyner Street, running parallel and immediately south of the
waterway.</NAV>
<REASON> This was annotated because it follows T1 and T5 as it implies a walk and mentions crossing a road and entering a street. </REASON>

<NAV>Vyner Street – at that time called John Street – was cut off from the land to the north, and began to develop a rather different character.</NAV>
<NAV>When you’ve had your fill of the pleasures of Vyner Street and its environs, walk back to the north bank of the canal and continue west. After a short while you come to another bridge, which carries a road leading to Broadway Market and then to London Fields.</NAV>
<NAV>Back on the towpath, the walk continues west, and we now get a better sense of how Regent’s Canal would have felt in its industrial heyday.</NAV>
<NAV>The first treat comes in the form of a splendid pair of operational locks which manipulate the water level, allowing barges coming from the Thames to navigate the higher ground of north London and to pass beneath a bridge carrying Queensbridge Road.</NAV>

<REASON> The first annotation was done because it most closely follows T1 as it implies a change in direction and character of the street.

<NAV>It is something we are reminded of again by a structure a little further to the west.
After a short stroll we pass below another bridge, this one carrying the
Kingsland Road – the Roman Ermine Street linking London to Lincoln and York –
which runs due north from Shoreditch.</NAV>
<NAV>Immediately to its west, on the north
side, there is the long and narrow Kingsland Basin – now tranquil but once
bustling with barges loading and unloading.</NAV>
<NAV>Very close by a large timber merchant was
located, presumably here because once it received its wares by barge.</NAV>
<NAV>The south
side of the canal at this point is lined with late-nineteenth and
early-twentieth-century buildings, many rising almost directly from the water
and offering a fine medley of simple functional design – the early ones in
brick, the later in reinforced concrete, or white-rendered blockwork, with large
steel-framed windows.</NAV>
<NAV>Located at 38–56 Orsman Road – parallel to and south of
the canal – the building’s fine art-deco form is revealed, with its striking
strips of glazing and asymmetrically placed corner tower.</NAV>
<NAV>An early
twentieth-century warehouse on Orsman Road backs on to the canal.</NAV>

<REASON> The first annotation was done because it most closely follows T1 as it implies a walk to the west and passing below a bridge.

The fifth annotation was done because it most closely follows T1 as it implies a walk parallel to and south of the canal. 
The sixth annotation was done because it most closely follows T1 as it implies a walk on Orsman Road. </REASON>

<NAV>Back on the north side of the canal, opposite the museum store, is the Barge House
restaurant, created within the ground floor of a recent building that fronts on
to De Beauvoir Crescent.</NAV>
<NAV>But immediately to the west of it is something that
seems much less but is, in fact, so much more. This is the Towpath Café,
composed of just a couple of holes in the basement wall of the large and bulky
industrial building that rises along the canal.</NAV>
<NAV>On the next portion of the walk, the towpath becomes wider, the feats of
engineering more ambitious.</NAV>
<NAV>The first sign of the increase in scale
is the brick-arched Whitmore Road bridge.</NAV>
<NAV>The apparently wider girth of the canal after the bridge is, in fact,
an illusion. The increased sense of space is suggested by the buildings, which
are generally lower and more distant because of the wider path.</NAV>
<NAV>This sense of
scale and seriousness is reinforced by the mighty Sturt’s Lock a few hundred
metres later, accompanied by a towering former pumping station that once
regulated the water levels of the canal.</NAV>
<NAV>The industrial feel of this portion of
the walk is reinforced by a stark, functional building just west of the New
North Road bridge, on the south bank. This is the store of the Museum of London.</NAV>

<NAV>Reflections dart and ripple
across the top of Whitmore Road bridge. Take, for example, the group of
nineteenth-century industrial buildings that stand a hundred metres past Sturt’s
Lock.</NAV>
<NAV> The site, complete with a tall brick chimney, is nearly a sixth of a
mile in length and rises above its own ‘marina’ walkway that offers moorings for
boats and barges.</NAV>
<NAV>As
we contninue west, we begin to approach the final walkable stretch of the
Regent’s Canal. A little further along we come across the long Wenlock Basin,
where ranks of gaily painted barges nestle below a canopy of trees.</NAV>
<NAV>At the Wharf Road bridge, a steep flight of
stairs rises to road level and to a modest early-Victorian pub – the Narrowboat
– which seems to totter at street level on the very edge of the shallow towpath
cutting.</NAV>

<NAV>On Wharf Road – running parallel and to the west of Wenlock Basin – stands the Victoria Miro Gallery, located in a nineteenth-century furniture factory.</NAV>
<NAV>We now approach the final, glorious, industrial crescendo of the walk. Rejoin the canal towpath and just a few metres west from the bridge is the stupendous City Road Basin, covering one and a half hectares in area.</NAV>
<NAV>The last short leg of the walk has a very different character. The waters now move between streets lined with salubrious early-nineteenth-century terraces, many with well-planted gardens.</NAV>

<NAV>And then the canal narrows and feeds into a deep, dark tunnel that
carries it for 878 metres below the heights of Islington and the Angel above.
There is no towpath so the walk ends here, in front of the splendid tunnel arch,</NAV>
<NAV>The only way to reach the other end of
Islington Tunnel, if not travelling by barge, is to ascend to the street and
continue west overground.</NAV>

<NAV>Our route starts at the south side of Victoria Park, at Bonner Hall Bridge –
best accessed by getting the Tube to Bethnal Green, a ten-minute walk away.</NAV>
<NAV>Before moving
on, take a moment to reflect on Victoria Park.</NAV>
<NAV>In particular the Pavilion Café, a few hundred metres to the east of
Bonner Hall Bridge, was a grisly affair, best avoided unless one wanted to
experience the stark reality of East End cuisine.</NAV>
<NAV>Now, like many in east London,
it has transformed into one of the best cafés mentioned in this book. It makes a
splendid place to begin the walk if you’re in need of a bite to eat or drink.</NAV>
<NAV>For those ready to plunge into Georgian industrial architecture, however, it is
best to walk to the western end of the park and through the canal gate on to the
towpath.</NAV>

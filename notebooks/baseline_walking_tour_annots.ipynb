The first portion of this route offers clues about the nature of east London before the arrival of the Regent’s Canal, taking in several buildings that predate the waterways, and whose fates were inexorably changed by its arrival. Before moving on, take a moment to reflect on Victoria Park. In the eighteenth century, this was all open pasture, interspersed with the odd brick kiln and market garden. The one notable feature was Bonner Hall, so called after the sixteenth-century bishop of London Edmund Bonner. All this was to change in the nineteenth century. As London expanded, calls for public parks grew; in 1840, Queen Victoria was presented with a petition signed by 30,000 residents. The Crown estate purchased 218 acres in the area and, over the next few years, converted it into Victoria Park. The park shares a family resemblance to Regent’s Park at the other end of the Regent’s Canal – no doubt down to the fact that its designer, James Pennethorne, was a protégé of none other than John Nash.6 The view south-east from Victoria Park’s Bonner Gate. When I first knew the park – many years ago – it was a fairly rough place. In particular the Pavilion Café, a few hundred metres to the east of Bonner Hall Bridge, was a grisly affair, best avoided unless one wanted to experience the stark reality of East End cuisine. Now, like many in east London, it has transformed into one of the best cafés mentioned in this book. It makes a splendid place to begin the walk if you’re in need of a bite to eat or drink. For those ready to plunge into Georgian industrial architecture, however, it is best to walk to the western end of the park and through the canal gate on to the towpath. Here, one can begin to imagine the feel of the canal in its early days: the canal side adjoining Victoria Park is used as moorings for barges, mostly residential, while across the waterway (which, as is usual, has a towpath – intended for the horses required to tow barges – generally on only one side) are',\n",

This bridge is a rare thing – a much-admired structure of great character, even though it was forged through endless committee meetings, compromise, contradiction, uncertainty and a fair degree of absurdity. It has a story worth considering at some length as you ascend from Tower Hill tube and stroll south across the bridge. The tale starts in the mid 1870s, when it was argued that a river crossing to the east of London Bridge would both improve communications in the City and, by providing direct access to industry on the south bank, increase the commercial potential of the docks on the north. There was, for practical reasons, only one site possible – a strip of land just east of the Tower of London – and a competition to find a suitable design was held. This was supervised by the City of London Corporation, which grabbed the initiative to build the new bridge. There was one key stipulation. It was not to block the access of tall-masted cargo ships to the wharves at the Pool of London, immediately to the west of the tower. To protect navigation the span of the proposed bridge had to be either incredibly high or it would have to open in some way to allow ships to pass through. Over fifty detailed designs were submitted. Most were weird and wonderful, including a swing bridge, a ‘roller’ bridge incorporating steam-operated sections that rolled from pier to pier, and a high-level bridge. All offered more or less workable solutions – some more expensive and complex than others – but all would visually overpower the historic tower and its setting. Many thought this far from desirable. Debate raged and two distinct interest groups emerged, each of which believed it should be responsible for the design and construction of the new bridge. There was the City Corporation, which had organised the competition and believed the proposed bridge was its responsibility. The City did, after all, begin just to the west of the site, and it had the funds to see the works to completion. They were to come from the City’s Bridge House estate, a body established in the early',\n",

The Crown estate purchased 218 acres in the area and, over the next few years, converted it into Victoria Park. The park shares a family resemblance to Regent’s Park at the other end of the Regent’s Canal – no doubt down to the fact that its designer, James Pennethorne, was a protégé of none other than John Nash.6 The view south-east from Victoria Park’s Bonner Gate. When I first knew the park – many years ago – it was a fairly rough place. In particular the Pavilion Café, a few hundred metres to the east of Bonner Hall Bridge, was a grisly affair, best avoided unless one wanted to experience the stark reality of East End cuisine. Now, like many in east London, it has transformed into one of the best cafés mentioned in this book. It makes a splendid place to begin the walk if you’re in need of a bite to eat or drink. For those ready to plunge into Georgian industrial architecture, however, it is best to walk to the western end of the park and through the canal gate on to the towpath. Here, one can begin to imagine the feel of the canal in its early days: the canal side adjoining Victoria Park is used as moorings for barges, mostly residential, while across the waterway (which, as is usual, has a towpath – intended for the horses required to tow barges – generally on only one side) are\n",

      "Our route starts at the south side of Victoria Park, at Bonner Hall Bridge – best accessed by getting the Tube to Bethnal Green, a ten-minute walk away. The first portion of this route offers clues about the nature of east London before the arrival of the Regent’s Canal, taking in several buildings that predate the waterways, and whose fates were inexorably changed by its arrival. Before moving on, take a moment to reflect on Victoria Park. In the eighteenth century, this was all open pasture, interspersed with the odd brick kiln and market garden. The one notable feature was Bonner Hall, so called after the sixteenth-century bishop of London Edmund Bonner. All this was to change in the nineteenth century. As London expanded, calls for public parks grew; in 1840, Queen Victoria was presented with a petition signed by 30,000 residents. The Crown estate purchased 218 acres in the area and, over the next few years, converted it into Victoria Park. The park shares a family resemblance to Regent’s Park at the other end of the Regent’s Canal – no doubt down to the fact that its designer, James Pennethorne, was a protégé of none other than John Nash.6 The view south-east from Victoria Park’s Bonner Gate.

Here, one can begin to imagine the feel of the canal in its early days: the canal side adjoining Victoria Park is used as moorings for barges, mostly residential, while across the waterway (which, as is usual, has a towpath – intended for the horses required to tow barges – generally on only one side) are\n",

This bridge is a rare thing – a much-admired structure of great\\ncharacter, even though it was forged through endless committee meetings,\\ncompromise, contradiction, uncertainty and a fair degree of absurdity. It has a\\nstory worth considering at some length as you ascend from Tower Hill tube and\\nstroll south across the bridge. The tale starts in the mid 1870s, when it was\\nargued that a river crossing to the east of London Bridge would both improve\\ncommunications in the City and, by providing direct access to industry on the\\nsouth bank, increase the commercial potential of the docks on the north. There\\nwas, for practical reasons, only one site possible – a strip of land just east\\nof the Tower of London – and a competition to find a suitable design was held.\\nThis was supervised by the City of London Corporation, which grabbed the\\ninitiative to build the new bridge. There was one key stipulation. It was not to\\nblock the access of tall-masted cargo ships to the wharves at the Pool of\\nLondon, immediately to the west of the tower. To protect navigation the span of\\nthe proposed bridge had to be either incredibly high or it would have to open in\\nsome way to allow ships to pass through. Over fifty detailed designs were\\nsubmitted. Most were weird and wonderful, including a swing bridge, a ‘roller’\\nbridge incorporating steam-operated sections that rolled from pier to pier, and\\na high-level bridge. All offered more or less workable solutions – some more\\nexpensive and complex than others – but all would visually overpower the\\nhistoric tower and its setting. Many thought this far from desirable. Debate\\nraged and two distinct interest groups emerged, each of which believed it should\\nbe responsible for the design and construction of the new bridge. There was the\\nCity Corporation, which had organised the competition and believed the proposed\\nbridge was its responsibility. The City did, after all, begin just to the west\\nof the site, and it had the funds to see the works to completion.

The City had, over the centuries, used the resulting money to buy\\nand develop property, and build other bridges across the Thames – notably\\nBlackfriars Bridge in the 1760s. By the 1870s the money was there to build the\\nproposed bridge by the tower. On the other hand there was the Metropolitan Board\\nof Works (MBW), which had been established in 1855 to improve London’s roads and\\nsewers (see p. 336). The engineer responsible for these works was Joseph\\nBazalgette, and in the mid 1870s he produced a design for the MBW for a\\nhigh-level bridge adjoining the tower. When the MBW submitted this scheme as\\npart of a private Parliamentary bill, the battle lines were drawn. The City – in\\nthe person of its architect Horace Jones – objected to the proposed design and\\nin 1879 submitted its alternative scheme. Designed by Jones himself, it solved\\nthe problems of navigation by proposing that the bridge should have a roadway\\nwhich rose to allow ships to pass. This solution also offered the opportunity\\nfor the new crossing to be designed as a medieval-style drawbridge or city gate:\\na composition that, argued the City, would allow the new structure to sit in\\nhappy harmony with the adjoining medieval Tower of London. Competing visions of\\nTower Bridge: the designs submitted by Joseph Bazelgette for the MBW (Top) and\\nHorace Jones for the City Corporation (Above). The logic of this suggestion gave\\nthe City the edge in the debate and the project moved inexorably into its hands.\\nAfter ironing out some technical problems – the drawbridge was originally to be\\nraised by chains, which promised to be so slow that it would almost always be\\nneither up nor down – a final design was settled upon, with the help of the\\nengineer John Wolfe Barry. Jones and Barry were grilled by a House of Commons\\nSelect Committee which established that, from the technical and operational\\npoint of view at least, the City’s proposal was a goer. And then, when all\\nseemed settled, Queen Victoria spoke up. The queen had opposed the bridge for\\nsome time: she feared that a new bridge, on the eastern edge of the Tower of'],\n",

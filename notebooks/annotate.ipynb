Before moving\\non, take a moment to reflect on Victoria Park. In the eighteenth century, this\\nwas all open pasture, interspersed with the odd brick kiln and market garden. The one notable feature\\nwas Bonner Hall, so called after the sixteenth-century bishop of London Edmund\\nBonner. All this was to change in the nineteenth century. As London expanded,\\ncalls for public parks grew; in 1840, Queen Victoria was presented with a\\npetition signed by 30,000 residents. The Crown estate purchased 218 acres in the\\narea and, over the next few years, converted it into Victoria Park. The park\\nshares a family resemblance to Regent’s Park at the other end of the Regent’s\\nCanal – no doubt down to the fact that its designer, James Pennethorne, was a\\nprotégé of none other than John Nash.6 The view south-east from Victoria Park’s\\nBonner Gate. When I first knew the park – many years ago – it was a fairly rough\\nplace. In particular the Pavilion Café, a few hundred metres to the east of\\nBonner Hall Bridge, was a grisly affair, best avoided unless one wanted to\\nexperience the stark reality of East End cuisine. Now, like many in east London,\\nit has transformed into one of the best cafés mentioned in this book. It makes a\\nsplendid place to begin the walk if you’re in need of a bite to eat or drink.\\nFor those ready to plunge into Georgian industrial architecture, however, it is\\nbest to walk to the western end of the park and through the canal gate on to the\\ntowpath. Here, one can begin to imagine the feel of the canal in its early days:\\nthe canal side adjoining Victoria Park is used as moorings for barges, mostly\\nresidential, while across the waterway (which, as is usual, has a towpath –\\nintended for the horses required to tow barges – generally on only one side) are\\nthe gardens of houses. This must be a delightful place to live, especially for\\nthe nautical-minded. Houses soon give way to light industrial buildings of\\nvarious dates, many now serving as homes or studios. The decaying Regency charm\\nof The Oval, now accompanied by two Victorian gasholders. When one crosses under\\nthe bridge carrying Cambridge Heath Road, everything changes. You are thrust\\ninto a splendidly gloomy vista, but one with a moving if modest grandeur.\\nImmediately west of the road bridge is a series of wide, shallow arches and a\\nmighty brick pier, presumably all part of a now-lost wharf or small basin that\\nonce ran south of the canal – complete with a small window in the pier\\nsuggesting that this massive piece of brick construction is inhabited. Above\\nthese works, and parallel to the road bridge, rises the metal bulk of the\\nVictorian railway bridge. The view westwards is enriched by the prospect of a\\nthree-storey stucco-clad Regency villa, embellished with no fewer than three\\nfull-height bows that offer a charming sinuous frontage to the canal.',\n",
       " 'And looming over all, to the west of the now sadly decaying villa, are the tall and\\nstark skeletal structures of a pair of nineteenth-century gasholders. It’s well\\nworth clambering off the canal here to take a closer look at this threatened\\npiece of industrial and once ornamental London. Go up the stairs to the east of\\nthe bridges, cross the Cambridge Heath Road/Mare Street bridge to the south side\\nof the canal and head down the grandly named Corbridge Crescent towards the\\nvilla. Several things now happen, and they are all most rewarding. A narrow\\nalley – Grove Passage – lurks below the crushing form of the railway viaduct,\\nand Corbridge Crescent suddenly exposes its early granite setts which, during my\\nlast visit at twilight, glistened with moisture and led to a strange and exotic\\nworld that unfolded around and in front of the Regency villa. This section of\\nthe canal was constructed between 1816 and 1820 and the villa appears to date\\nfrom around then. Upon closer inspection, it is – despite mutilations – not in\\nsuch bad condition as it first looks. The cornice has gone, and the front door\\nbeen butchered, but windows are in reasonable order and a light shines from one.\\nIt’s inhabited, at least in part. To the rear is a large, red-brick wing. A\\nnotice is fixed next to a small door, which offers a flashback to the old East\\nEnd: ‘Soup Kitchen … open weekdays 10 to 2, Saturdays 10 to 1, Sundays 11 to 1.’\\nThis marks the end of Corbridge Crescent, which now leads to The Oval – a small\\npiece of neoclassical town planning that incorporated an elongated circus,\\nsomewhat in the Nash manner of Regent’s Park. What high ambitions these names\\nevoke. The crumbling villa is the solitary survivor of a crescent, perhaps\\nruined by the arrival of the railway. Or it was perhaps the fault of the canal\\nitself. Crescent and Oval – located just off the Hackney Road – were new\\ncreations in 1820 when the canal arrived but were, in the words of The Buildings\\nof England, ‘hopelessly compromised’ by the social transformation brought about\\nby this industrial thoroughfare.7 Today, all that’s left of The Oval is its\\nform, now defined by a scattering of low and mostly mean twentieth-century\\nindustrial structures and by its central island, still framed by robust granite\\nkerbs, but no longer planted – just an oval of beaten earth littered with urban\\ndetritus. Only a short distance away, on Hackney Road, there are still\\nsubstantial rows of early-nineteenth-century terraces and semi-detached villas.\\nSuch lofty Georgian ambitions stand in stark contrast to the use of The Oval\\nnow. The villa, the land and later buildings that surround it are occupied by\\nEmpress Coaches. Everywhere are coaches, campers and buses of different types\\nand sizes, being serviced and cleaned. It has its own surreal charm: in the yard\\nnext door, fellows go about their business; one chap with black and shiny hair,\\nin an outsize jacket, ambles around smoking a cigarette.',\n",
       " 'Everything looks like a flashback to the 1950s. This magical, individual and living piece of workaday\\nLondon is, of course, under threat. Instead of coaches and oily workshops all is\\nto be cleared away for a ‘mixed use’ development containing over 500 square\\nmetres of ‘commercial floor space’ and 116 flats. Consent was granted by Tower\\nHamlets Council in December 2008. So all this now exists on borrowed time –\\nindeed demolition might have taken place by the time you visit. This is how\\ncities die and how character is lost: gradually, stealthily, bit by bit.\\nTowering over the villa to the west are the pair of gasholders. This portion of\\nthe Regent’s Canal has been home to gasworks since the Georgian period. The\\npioneering Imperial Gas Light and Coke Company, which had been founded in 1812\\nto supply gas to light England’s streets, gained control of the current site of\\nHaggerston Park in 1821, at a time when the canal was still largely surrounded\\nby open fields.8 The second decade of the nineteenth century had witnessed an\\nextraordinary growth in the amount of gas lighting in Britain. In 1812, there\\nwas only one gas company; just fifteen years later, every town with a population\\nover 10,000 had a gas supply. The resultant change to urban life was enormous –\\nsuddenly, nightfall ceased to represent the end of the day’s work or ambling,\\nand became a new opportunity for labour and pleasure-seeking. The solitary\\nsurvival of a crescent of Regency houses on The Oval. The gasholders on\\nCorbridge Crescent are somewhat later. They reveal the wonderful way the\\nmid-nineteenth-century mind – intoxicated by the thrill and pomp of the past –\\ncould, with only a little appropriate ornament, turn even a functional\\nindustrial structure into architecture stamped with the cultural pedigree of\\nhistory. The smaller of them has vertical stanchions fashioned as two tiers of\\nsixteen classical columns – denuded Corinthian over Doric – evidently calculated\\nto evoke the power and form of the Colosseum in Rome. Interestingly this type of\\nclassically embellished rotunda was pioneered for a now-demolished gasholder\\nbuilt on this site in 1856; the current smaller one dates from 1865 and was\\ndesigned by Joseph Clarke, with the columns cast by the famed Staveley Coal and\\nIron Company of Derbyshire, and the neighbouring taller but simpler gasholder\\nconstructed in 1888–9.9 Now, these gasholders no longer inflate and, if a battle\\nis not waged, are probably not long for this world. Their majestic and\\nsculptural forms, which make a vital contribution to the scene, are due to be\\ndemolished, despite protestations by the local heritage group the Hackney\\nSociety. Before returning to the canal, cross to the east side of Cambridge\\nHeath Road and into Vyner Street, running parallel and immediately south of the\\nwaterway. In the early nineteenth century this cobbled thoroughfare was on the\\noutskirts of a conurbation that sprawled north, up to the area around London\\nFields.',\n",
       " 'But everything changed with the arrival of the Regent’s Canal. Vyner\\nStreet – at that time called John Street – was cut off from the land to the\\nnorth, and began to develop a rather different character.10 Two centuries later\\nthis small street became the unlikely heart of east and north-east London’s\\nburgeoning art scene. New galleries set up here to show not the established\\ntrends or artists, nor the ‘mainstream’, but an eclectic mix of what was\\n‘upcoming’ and experimental. But as is the way with such spontaneous eruptions,\\nthe peak is soon passed as corporate interest muscles in. The low rents have now\\nspiralled up, so the vibrant little art world here has become something of a\\nvictim of its own success. Some of the pioneering galleries have moved on –\\nmostly west to Fitzrovia – and the art scene of Vyner Street has itself become\\npart of East End history. Nonetheless, at the time of writing there are still\\nsome galleries worth visiting, especially on the first Thursday evening of the\\nmonth when many host events. There are also a few pubs nearby that are more than\\ndecent, and where local artists gather: the Victory in Vyner Street, the \\nHare at 505 Cambridge Heath Road (a modest three-storey mid-nineteenth-century\\nbuilding that retains much of the atmosphere of a Bethnal Green local) and the\\nBistrotheque at 23–27 Wadeson Street. This is a sophisticated bar and restaurant\\nhoused in battered but large-roomed former industrial buildings, which hosts\\nerudite talks and, famously, outrageously camp cabaret evenings. The\\nBistrotheque has been going for some years now, remains popular and seems\\never-expanding, but was initially amazing simply for being here at all, stuck\\ndown a Bethnal Green backstreet and secreted amongst anonymous post-war factory\\nbuildings. When you’ve had your fill of the pleasures of Vyner Street and its\\nenvirons, walk back to the north bank of the canal and continue west. After a\\nshort while you come to another bridge, which carries a road leading to Broadway\\nMarket and then to London Fields. This is an old market street that now has two\\ngood pubs – the Dove, and the Cat and Mutton – said to have occupied the site\\nsince 1790.11 Acton’s Lock. The lock-keeper lived in the house on the right\\nuntil the 1980s. But when I first explored it twenty-five or so years ago,\\nBroadway Market was a desolate place. Most of the array of shops – including one\\nsplendid Regency affair – were run-down or closed, sitting alongside a few\\nold-time cafés, a pie and mash shop, and a couple of rough-looking pubs. All has\\nnow changed, and Broadway Market has become one of the most sophisticated and\\npopular Saturday markets in London, with its down-at-heel shops and cafés reborn\\nas exquisite eateries and delicatessens. Back on the towpath, the walk continues\\nwest, and we now get a better sense of how Regent’s Canal would have felt in its\\nindustrial heyday. The first treat comes in the form of a splendid pair of\\noperational locks which manipulate the water level, allowing barges coming from\\nthe Thames to navigate the higher ground of north London and to pass beneath a\\nbridge carrying Queensbridge Road. This is Acton’s Lock, so called for William\\nLee Acton, on whose land this portion of the canal was built. Until the 1980s,\\nthe lock-keeper’s family lived in the neighbouring cottage. These days, being\\ngenerally operated by relaxed holidaymakers who have hired their barges, it is\\neasy to forget the extraordinary feat of engineering the locks represent.',\n",
       " 'One Victorian description of a trip down Regent’s Canal, by the writer and\\ntheatrical producer John Hollingshead, does a good job of reminding us. His\\nfriend tells him how our frail bark, the Stourport, will be admitted into a\\ndeep, narrow, oblong, brick well; and how, as soon as we are in the dreadful\\ntrap, two massive iron-bound timber gates will close behind us in such a manner\\nthat the more the pressure is increased from behind, the tighter will they bind\\nthemselves together. Then he draws a fearfully vivid picture of the two gates in\\nfront of us – a single, slender barrier, that alone opposes the advance of an\\nocean – a hundred thousand tons of water forty feet above our heads, fretting to\\nbe at us, like a bear looking down from his pole upon the tender children\\noutside his pit.12 Such reflections do a good job of conjuring the\\nnineteenth-century awe at the industry and scale of the waterways. It is\\nsomething we are reminded of again by a structure a little further to the west.\\nAfter a short stroll we pass below another bridge, this one carrying the\\nKingsland Road – the Roman Ermine Street linking London to Lincoln and York –\\nwhich runs due north from Shoreditch. Immediately to its west, on the north\\nside, there is the long and narrow Kingsland Basin – now tranquil but once\\nbustling with barges loading and unloading. It illustrates how the canal\\noperated in its prime. Barges were pulled by horse-power to strategically placed\\nlocations such as this – many adjacent to a main road – where goods were\\ntransferred between barge and dray. Very close by a large timber merchant was\\nlocated, presumably here because once it received its wares by barge. The south\\nside of the canal at this point is lined with late-nineteenth and\\nearly-twentieth-century buildings, many rising almost directly from the water\\nand offering a fine medley of simple functional design – the early ones in\\nbrick, the later in reinforced concrete, or white-rendered blockwork, with large\\nsteel-framed windows. These are typical of the industrial and utilitarian\\nbuildings that, in north-east and east London, grew up along the banks of the\\ncanal. The buildings were served by the canal and confirmed its purpose. But\\nhere industry has long gone and the canal is now no more than a glorious\\nornament and place of pleasure. The buildings now mostly contain flats and\\nartists’ studios and, when I strolled along the canal, on a sunny weekday\\nafternoon, the activities were more than just the expected. There were, of\\ncourse, the dog-walkers, joggers, bikers and oddball fishermen who really could\\nnot have hoped to catch much that was edible. But also an array of ambitious\\ncontemporary architecture and one anonymous industrial-looking building called\\nFranks House that is, of all things, the store for the British Museum’s\\nEthnography Department. Located at 38–56 Orsman Road – parallel to and south of\\nthe canal – the building’s fine art-deco form is revealed, with its striking\\nstrips of glazing and asymmetrically placed corner tower. An early\\ntwentieth-century warehouse on Orsman Road backs on to the canal.',\n",
       " 'Back on the north side of the canal, opposite the museum store, is the Barge House\\nrestaurant, created within the ground floor of a recent building that fronts on\\nto De Beauvoir Crescent. But immediately to the west of it is something that\\nseems much less but is, in fact, so much more. This is the Towpath Café,\\ncomposed of just a couple of holes in the basement wall of the large and bulky\\nindustrial building that rises along the canal. Outside each slit-like hole is\\nan array of simple chairs, a few tables and perhaps a bowl or two of water to\\nquench the thirst of passing dogs. It’s the perfect place for a canal-side\\nwalker to grab a coffee, a freshly-pressed fruit juice, a sandwich or cake and –\\nif the weather is right – a wonderful place to sit. When I first found Towpath I\\nwas hungry and thirsty from a long walk and it really was like coming upon an\\noasis. During the past few years it has expanded, and now colonises a wide\\nstretch of canal-side structures, with lots of exterior seating. The building\\nthat rises high above the café was built as a printworks, but is one no longer,\\nand eased itself into local legend in the 1960s and 70s by becoming the\\npowerhouse for that lost generation of erotic magazines filled with scantily\\ndressed young women. These publications have, of course, been superseded by far\\nsterner fare. But back when the presses were in full production, the towpath\\nbecame the haunt of cavorting and noisy boys who were determined to get the\\nirritated printers to stone them with bundles of ‘adult’ magazines. The former\\nprintworks is a fine piece of 1930s architecture, with a bow-fronted staircase\\ntower. On the next portion of the walk, the towpath becomes wider, the feats of\\nengineering more ambitious. We are, it seems, entering one of the heartlands of\\nthe late-Georgian industrial metropolis. The first sign of the increase in scale\\nis the brick-arched Whitmore Road bridge. These early canal bridges really are\\nfine pieces of early-nineteenth-century engineering. They are made in\\ntraditional manner of traditional materials – essentially Roman in inspiration –\\nand are robust and handsome in their utilitarian simplicity. They also sometimes\\nhave a strikingly if unintended picturesque quality. The gently curving arch of\\nthis bridge frames splendid views along the canal and, because of its generous\\nwidth, reflections from the water are able to ripple and dart within its dark\\nand cavernous interior. The passage within it is dank and echoing: a strange and\\nalarming underworld through which bikers and pedestrians rush from sunshine to\\nsunshine. The apparently wider girth of the canal after the bridge is, in fact,\\nan illusion. The increased sense of space is suggested by the buildings, which\\nare generally lower and more distant because of the wider path. This sense of\\nscale and seriousness is reinforced by the mighty Sturt’s Lock a few hundred\\nmetres later, accompanied by a towering former pumping station that once\\nregulated the water levels of the canal. The industrial feel of this portion of\\nthe walk is reinforced by a stark, functional building just west of the New\\nNorth Road bridge, on the south bank. This is the store of the Museum of London.\\nIt is an Aladdin’s cave of wonders, many not simply archived away or stashed in\\nfiling cabinets but displayed splendidly in glass cases.',\n",
       " 'In my view some of the museum’s most intriguing objects are kept here, hustled out of the main City\\nbuilding by showier pieces calculated to appeal to popular taste. Again, as with\\nthe British Museum store, this Eagle Wharf Road repository can be viewed by\\nappointment, and for some it could be a rewarding termination to this walk. That\\nwould be a shame, for there is yet more to see. Reflections dart and ripple\\nacross the top of Whitmore Road bridge. Take, for example, the group of\\nnineteenth-century industrial buildings that stand a hundred metres past Sturt’s\\nLock. This striking complex was once home to the Regent’s Canal Ironworks – the\\nfoundry of the master ironworker Henry Grissell. Along with his cousin Samuel\\nMorton Peto, Grissell became one of the leading public-works contractors of the\\nearly nineteenth century – contributing to structures ranging from Nelson’s\\nColumn to Clerkenwell Prison,\\nand designing ironwork for the gates around Buckingham Palace and the British\\nMuseum. The site, complete with a tall brick chimney, is nearly a sixth of a\\nmile in length and rises above its own ‘marina’ walkway that offers moorings for\\nboats and barges. Some years ago the complex was converted into the Holborn\\nStudios, made up of photographic studios and a pleasant water-side restaurant\\nand bar called the Commissary. The Studios have long been recognised as an\\nexemplary piece of regeneration, in which old buildings have been retained and\\nnew life created. Now all is under threat. The owners want to ‘develop’ the site\\nas flats and ‘commercial space’, which could mean the destruction of some of the\\nold buildings, the loss of jobs and the closure of the Studios. It all seems\\nincredible – and very sad. The Holborn Studios is exactly the sort of place that\\ngives the canal character and creative energy, and is a great example of the\\nways in which buildings can change and adapt. This is, in general, a most\\nsensible approach. Existing buildings represent ‘embedded’ energy that it is a\\ncrime to squander – something that many developers rarely seem to appreciate. As\\nwe contninue west, we begin to approach the final walkable stretch of the\\nRegent’s Canal. A little further along we come across the long Wenlock Basin,\\nwhere ranks of gaily painted barges nestle below a canopy of trees. It’s now\\nhard to believe that this was ever a working wharf. It was, of course, once\\nconsidered a mighty and daunting feat of engineering – and one that very nearly\\nfailed. In 1826, while still being constructed, the dam across the entrance\\ncollapsed, causing the main canal’s water level to drop by 13 inches and halting\\ntraffic on the waterway. The Narrowboat pub viewed from City Road Basin,\\nshielded from view by the outsized parapets on Wharf Road bridge. The dauntingly\\nindustrial atmosphere these waterways must once have had is proven by another\\nstructure, further to the west. At the Wharf Road bridge, a steep flight of\\nstairs rises to road level and to a modest early-Victorian pub – the Narrowboat\\n– which seems to totter at street level on the very edge of the shallow towpath\\ncutting. But most striking of all are the parapets of the Wharf Road bridge – in\\nparticular, their height. They are far too large to see over. The design is a\\nreminder that, in the early nineteenth century, the canal was not regarded as an\\nornament but as an industrial highway, at best a place of drudgery and at worst\\na realm haunted by queer canal folk.',\n",
       " 'In the nineteenth-century imagination, these canal-dwellers came to be seen as the lowest and most alien of people –\\nworthy of pity or even disdain. Take the following description from an 1888\\nnovel Life in the Cut, in which one character describes a ten-year-old child who\\nlives on a canal boat as ‘dreadful, so dirty, starved and stunted, she scarcely\\nseemed a child, more like a wicked hobgoblin; though she did not look wicked\\neither, only wretched and forlorn, nursing another fearful-looking, more uncanny\\natom than herself.’13 The canals and their inhabitants, it seems, were to be\\ngreatly feared. Now, of course, precisely the opposite is the case – as\\ndemonstrated by the archly high-end art gallery that we now approach. On Wharf\\nRoad – running parallel and to the west of Wenlock Basin – stands the Victoria\\nMiro Gallery, located in a nineteenth-century furniture factory. The interior\\noffers a vast and minimal space reminiscent of warehouse galleries in New York,\\nbut some original elements have been suffered to survive, including a few roof\\ntimbers and worn floorboards. The architect is Trevor Horne, a specialist in\\nsuch stripped-back contemporary design, often with retained, although greatly\\nadapted, old buildings. The garden backing on to the Wenlock Basin was created\\nby the artist Ian Hamilton Finlay, and the gallery itself houses works by Chris\\nOfili, Grayson Perry, the Chapman brothers and Peter Doig. The whole affair\\noffers a fascinating perspective of the upper-slopes of the London ‘art scene’.\\nConfident, wealthy and brilliantly contemporary without being overtly brash –\\nand a million miles from the gritty industrial aesthetic the building originally\\npossessed. We now approach the final, glorious, industrial crescendo of the\\nwalk. Rejoin the canal towpath and just a few metres west from the bridge is the\\nstupendous City Road Basin, covering one and a half hectares in area. The waters\\nhere are wide and the view to the south tremendous. Standing on the wide quay\\nthe City seems to open up, with the water of the basin a highway to its heart.\\nYou can see the obelisk spire of the 1730s St Luke’s church on Old Street, the\\nserrated profile of one of the Barbican towers and – as now with so many\\nviewpoints in London – the soaring, tapering and somewhat surreal silhouette of\\nthe Shard next to far-distant London Bridge station. Opened in 1820, the City\\nRoad Basin became the heart and soul of the canal in the 1890s. Goods and\\nmaterials were offloaded to be dispersed around the surrounding area, and\\nproducts loaded for transportation around London and Britain or for export\\nabroad via the docks to the east. There were flower and timber wharves, coal\\ndepots – even Pickfords, the house-removal company, had a depot here. The\\nsurrounding buildings are varied, nineteenth century and modern, but most are\\ntough and big-boned. It’s a pleasing place to loiter and contemplate the city,\\nwith the atmosphere of urban industry still present but transformed into\\nsomething less grimy and challenging. When I was there one of the barges, moored\\nnearby on the north towpath, offered home-cooked Slovakian food. An engraving of\\nCity Road Basin from 1828 offers a glimpse of the late-Georgian industrial\\nmetropolis, with St Luke’s Church obelisk towering in the distance. The last\\nshort leg of the walk has a very different character. The waters now move\\nbetween streets lined with salubrious early-nineteenth-century terraces, many\\nwith well-planted gardens. The canal-side becomes bucolic, with houses glimpsed\\nthrough the rich array of trees. Suddenly we are in a kind of Eden, a splendid\\nexample of the late-Georgian obsession for creating rus in urbe, with stern and\\nuniform terraces framed and softened by informal clumps of trees and gardens. We\\nare in the heart of the city but it feels like we are walking through glades and\\ngroves. The canal becomes a place of fantasy, of heavy engineering inspired by',\n",
       " 'the romance of history. Here the imagination is inflamed by low-arched and\\nantique-looking bridges – utterly Roman in feel – and by secret bowers, with\\ntheir chairs and tables manipulated to ideal positions by the nearby\\nterrace-dwellers.',\n",
       " 'The theatrical entrance to Islington Tunnel, designed by James\\nMorgan. And then the canal narrows and feeds into a deep, dark tunnel that\\ncarries it for 878 metres below the heights of Islington and the Angel above.\\nThere is no towpath so the walk ends here, in front of the splendid tunnel arch,\\ndesigned in heroic style by James Morgan in the visually powerful Baroque manner\\nof Sir John Vanbrugh. The opening is in a gentle catenary curve – a much\\nstronger shape than a semicircular arch – and there is a heavy keystone and two\\nsquat and tough-looking Grecian Doric pilasters. It looks like the theatrical\\nopening to some operatic dungeon. But despite its ornamental appearance, the\\ntunnel was in its day a great feat of practical engineering. It was built\\nbetween 1815–18 by navvies using horse-and manpower and explosives, with the\\nspoil carried away in wheelbarrows. When the canal opened bargees had to ‘leg’\\ntheir boats through the tunnel – in other words, lie on their back and punt the\\nbarges through by pushing with their legs against the tunnel roof. This hideous,\\nback-breaking work was necessary until a steam tug was installed in 1826 that\\nheaved barges through in a continuous chain. In other tunnels, legging was\\nnecessary until well into the nineteenth century. John Hollingshead witnessed\\nthe system on another canal in 1860, and described the moment two boats passed.\\n‘It was necessary to leave off legging, for the boats to pass each other, and\\nthe leggers waited until the last moment when a concussion seemed inevitable,\\nand then sprang instantaneously, with singular dexterity, on to the sides of\\ntheir boats, pulling their narrow platforms up immediately after them,’ he\\nwrote. It was, in his rendering, a peculiarly beautiful scene. The action of the\\nlight in front of our boat produced a very fantastic shadow of our recumbent\\nboatman-legger upon the side wall of the tunnel. As his two legs stuck out\\nhorizontally from the edge of the legging-board, treading, one over the other,\\nagainst the wall, they threw a shadow of two arms, which seemed to be held by a\\nthin old man – another shadow of the same substance – bent nearly double at the\\nstomach, who worked them over and over, as if turning two great mangle-handles\\nwith both hands at the same time.14 The only way to reach the other end of\\nIslington Tunnel, if not travelling by barge, is to ascend to the street and\\ncontinue west overground. That, though, is another walk. For now, merely take a\\nmoment to look back east and reflect on the extraordinary achievement of the\\nlate-Georgian waterways, and the way they transformed the British economy. It\\nwas a feat that contemporaries were highly conscious of. The English poet and\\nessayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld captured the optimism of the canal age in a 1773\\npoem, ‘The Invitation’, which reflects on the remarkable changes that the\\nwaterways had brought to the English landscape: Here smooth canals, across th’\\nextended plain, Stretch their long arms, to join the distant main: The sons of\\ntoil with many a weary stroke Scoop the hard bosom of the solid rock … The\\ntraveller with pleasing wonder sees The white sail gleaming thro’ the dusky\\ntrees; And views the alter’d landscape with surprise, And doubts the magic\\nscenes which round him rise.']"
